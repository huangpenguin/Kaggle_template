### basic steps of carrying out experiment fast

1. EDA
2. Feature Engineering, coming up with additional features
3. Feature Selection, trimming the amount of features down somewhat with Boruta algo
4. Model Selection, trying out different models, see what works best
5. Model Interpretation, with the awesome shap package. One workbook for a catboost model, one for a lasso model. Neither is superior
9. Tried to apply fastai deeplearning to the dataset, didn't give a good result
